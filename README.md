Introduction
============

Minicluster is a library for setting up infrastructure.

It can be used in various ways:

* as a platform-engineering tool for developers
* for black-box testing and system testing in failure scenarios
* to develop cloud-based Linux images
* for setting up and operating homelabs
* for safe deployment to production of provably working systems
* for testing dedicated hardware by giving control over the kernel and kernel drivers

By combining these aspects within the same organization, it can cover the full needs, from development to operating software.

Minicluster is optimized for

* developer experience
* gaining knowledge
* robust, reproducible environments
* promoting the infrastructure to production with peace of mind
* observability

Example Use-Cases
